# Digital-Design-Project
Digital Design second year group project

## This is the code for building a Peak Detecor. It's noteworthy that the Data generator was given and ready to use. 
As can be seen in Fig 4.1, There are tow main sections for this project, they're both designed and programmed using VHDL in Modesim and Vivado for simulation, namely Command Processor & Data Processor

### Command Processor
I was in the team where we were responsible for building the architecture of the Command Processor and simulation testing. Basically it receives commands from the terminal(a series input of strings on Putty), excute it and pass the task to the Data Processor to aquire the amount of data requested based on different functionalities.

### Data Processor 
The other half of my team was responsible for building the unit to process the data that we've requested and send it back to the Command processor and output it on the terminal.
